        <p id="bio">
            I’m a multi-instrumentalist, including violin, guitar, trumpet, and voice. I started taking classical violin
            lessons when I was 8, and grew up playing old-time fiddle music with my mom in New Hampshire. I've always
            loved exploring new instruments, and began playing guitar more seriously in college and afterwards in bands.
            No matter what age or genre, I believe music lessons should be fun and creative, and facilitate general
            musicality! I’ll help you learn both to read sheet music and play by ear, incorporate basic music theory,
            and most importantly develop your ability to express yourself on the instrument. I’m excited to offer
            beginner violin and guitar lessons for children and adults ages 8 and up! Whether you or your child are
            looking to play classical music or old-time fiddle, we’ll talk through your goals and passions and get
            started! I’ve played in several bands and ensembles, taught violin lessons at Wheeler School in Providence,
            RI and coached bands at Girl’s Rock, and I look forward to being your teacher! I’m located in Virginia
            Highland, and offer in-home lessons in nearby neighborhoods.
